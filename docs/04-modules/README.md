All 13 module playbooks are published and accepted. Final documentation acceptance is published in `docs/06-reports/accepted/FINAL_DOCUMENTATION_ACCEPTANCE_v1.0.md` and remains pending only exact final server synchronization.

Every playbook includes purpose/boundaries, data owner, confirmed and open decisions, public inputs/outputs, allowed/forbidden changes, immutable common contracts, dependencies/fakes, fixtures/test vectors, acceptance criteria, roadmap, report/handoff and append-only history.

A playbook is a prerequisite only. It does not authorize code, dependency installation, database, migrations, agents, routes, tunnels, ports, provider calls, notifications, services or deployment without a separate exact owner decision and gated task.
